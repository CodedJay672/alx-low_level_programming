**WELCOME TO THE POINTERS TO FUNCTION DIRECTORY**

A pointer doesn't just point to data and addresses, they also point to functions i.e different lines of code. Pointers to functions is a great way tha C prevents code redundancy. In this directory there are files containing C codes demonstrating different ways that pointers to function can be implemented.

C IS FUN!!!
