**WELCOME TO STRUCT DIRECTORY**

Struct is like an array only different in the sense that arrays allow you to store values of same tyoes but, struct on the other hand, will allow you to store values of different types. to define a strct in C we use the **_struct_** keyword followed  by the structure tag name.

The body of the structure will contain the structure variables declared like normal C variables. the directory contains files written in C.
