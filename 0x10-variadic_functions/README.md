**WELCOME TO THE VARIABLE FUNCTION DIRECTORY**

Variadic functions are functions that can have variable nmmber of functions. In C, functions can accept variable number of arguments by including elipses after the named arguments. arguments are seperated by commas.

The standard <stdarg.h> file is included to work with this types of functions as they allow us to use the standard macros like va_list, va_start and va_end. this macros can be used to access unnamed parameters passed to the functions.

This is a directory containing C prgram files demonstrating variadic functions and its implementation.
