WELCOME TO THE RECURSION DIRECTORY

Recursion is a process whereby a function calls itself. this creates a kind of repititiveness until a **base case** is reached which causes the recursion to end. Recursion makes uses of the stacking method to perform this activity. aAn aalternative method for recursion is **Iteration**.

The directory contains .C files which contain recursion functions written in C. the functions illustrate how several tasks can be carried out with recursion
