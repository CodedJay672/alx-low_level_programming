**WELCOME TO THE **_malloc_** AND **_free_** DIRECTORY**

Dynamic memory allocation is the opposite of Automatic memory allocation where the program allocates memory addresses to variables, arrays automatically. Dynamic memory allocation allows us to allocate as much bytes as we need in our progamThe malloc function allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a pointr to the allocated memory. This memory will have read-write permissions.

After the allocated memory has finished its work, it is important to free up the memory and return it to the operating system to avoid a segdump error. 

The free function is used to deallocate memory and return them back to the operating system.
