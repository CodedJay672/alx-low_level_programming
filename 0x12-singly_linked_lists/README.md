**WELCOME TO SINGLY LINKED LISTS DIRECTORY**

Data structures are the different means by which data is stored in memory for easy access and manipulation. there are two types of data structures they are:

	linear and dynamic data structures.


unlike arrays which store data in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store data in a list which is made up of nodes linked together through keys. the first node is known as the head. the node has a data field and a link field which links the nodes together.

this directory contains .c files which contains programs written in C to illustrate the implementation of linked lists in C.
