**WELCOME TO THE FILE MANIPULATION DIRECTORY**

The C programming languge gives us different means to work with files . They include the open(), read(), write() and close functions. This functions are requested by the current program running a process. this request is then either granted or denied by the OS kernel.

this directory contains .c files which demonstrate the different ways that files can be manipulated using the C programming language.

C is fun!!!
