**WELCOME TO THE LIBRARIES DIRECTORY**

A library is a collection of code routines (functions, classes, variables and so on) that can be called when building a program instead of writing it ourselves.

Two types are:

	**Static libraries**

	**Shared (or Dynamic) libraries**

**_STATIC LIBRARIES_**

A static library is a file containing a collection of object files with extension (.o), that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation but not relevant during runtime.

This directory contains libraries which are written in C. C Programming is FUN!!!
