**WELCOME TO THE **_argc_** and **_argv_** REPOSITORY**

In C programming, there are 2 prototypes for the **int main()** function. The usual skeletal method is:

int main(void);

this main prototype, accepts no argument. However, there is another prototype which is 

int main(int argc, char* argv[]);

this prototype allows the program that implements this main function to include parameters which the program can use in running effectively. The **argc** argument is an integer value which is the same as the number of strings in the argv array.
